# JSON based browser bookmark migration tool
This Powershell script will migrate bookmarks from one browser that uses the JSON based bookmarks folder (Chrome/Edge) to another browser using the same JSON format.  

The script considers whether a bookmark already exists and preserves the folder structure.
